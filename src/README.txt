-:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:--:¦:-


This game is a twist on the classic board game, The Game of Life. Enter as a freshman CS major at the Cornell University and find your path through a series of events and major life decisions. You will get to choose your class(es) and advisor as well as your internship plans and your future. Earn and lose points throughout your path. You can also earn karma--how much? You won't know until you graduate. So are you ready for this adventure?

HOW TO PLAY

Starting the game: 
    1) make clean
    2) make play

Setting up the game:
    After make play the game will prompt you for a course roster.
    
    There are two main course rosters you can choose from:
        short.json : This is shorter version of the game! With only fifty squares, you get a small taste of the Life of a CS Major. 

        life.json: This is the full game!

    Type in the chosen course roster. 

    The game will now prompt you for the number of players. The Life of a CS 
    major can only support up to eight players. 

    Next the game will prompt you for each player's name and whether the 
    player is a human or not. Non human players are an AI that 
    take a turn and decision automatically. 

    Playing by yourself, but want a 
    companion? Choose one of two players and make one of them the AI!

Playing the game:
    Play the game by typing in commands based
    on the prompt. All commands are case insensitive!

    To take a turn: type spin
    For a list of all commands: type help
    To see your name: type name or n
    To see your college: type college or co
    To see your course: type course or c
    To see your advisor: type advisor or a
    To see your summer plans: type summer or sp
    To see your resume: type resume or r
    To see your points: type points or p

    When you come across a fork in your path, the game will
    ask you if you want to go left or right. For these decisions,
    type in l for left or r for right. 

    Sometimes, you will have to make a decision (for example,
    picking a course or advisor...etc). For these decisions, 
    simply type in the number that corresponds to the choice you pick. 

    Except for the base commands, the game will always inform 
    you what commands are available for decisions and forks. 

    Once you reach the end of the game, you will be taken out. 
    Wait for all your friends to finish playing. 

    When everyone has reached the end of the game, you will
    see who is the winner!
